        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Context</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
          In the Fall of 2020, my sister and I started a company to support
          elementary school learners during the pandemic. We needed (1) a brand
          identity and (2) a website that our current clients could use as a
          home base, as well as something for potential clients to browse
          through.
        </p>
        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Logo Process</h2>
        <p>
          Once we decided on our company name, we needed a brand logo! I tested
          out many different base fonts, looking for something modern and
          playful. Below are some of the different fonts that I looked at.
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-fluid mb-5"
          src="assets/ljunglearning/type-choices.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          I thought "Snicker" would do the perfect job as our logo's base font
          (second row, second column above), though I was not fond of the "N."
          So, I took the liberty of simplifying it. I also decided that the
          typeface alone was too plain. So, I added a star between the L and the
          J. It definitely added some intrigue, but it still didn't feel quite
          right.
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-fluid mb-5"
          src="assets/ljunglearning/ljung-star.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
        <p>
          I shared my design with a friend, who pointed out that I was missing
          an obvious branding opportunity! I'm from Chicago, and the Chicago
          flag features 4 6-pointed stars. So, I added a point to our star,
          giving meaning to an otherwise arbitrary design choice. Here are the
          final logos:
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-fluid mb-5"
          src="assets/ljunglearning/Ljung_Branding_Guidelines.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Colors</h2>
        <p>
          I settled on playful brand colors to best appeal to our target
          audience: parents looking for fun learning supplementation. I'm
          particularly fond of purple, so I chose a deep violet as the brand's
          primary color. I also added a contrasting color (pink) and two
          complementary neutral colors (blue-ish gray and white).
        </p>
        <img
          class="img-fluid mb-5"
          src="assets/ljunglearning/ljung-colors.jpg"
          alt=""
        />
        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Company Site</h2>
        <p>
          With the colors and other brand guidelines now set, I fleshed out our
          website in Wordpress, taking advantage of the Elementor pagebuilder. I
          made sure to make an excellent contact page, as well as a thorough
          "About" page to entice future clients. Here's the Contact page below,
          and feel free to visit the
          <a href="https://ljunglearning.com" target="_blank">site</a> itself!
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-center mb-4">Takeaways</h2>
        <p class="mb-5">
          For starters, I learned that sharing unfinished work can be hugely
          beneficial. The best idea for our logo (the 6-pointed Chicago star)
          came from one of my friends, who has no stake in the company. In
          addition, I learned a great deal about the expansive Wordpress
          platform. The site was built using the Elementor page builder, but it
          also incorporates other practical web funtionality, such as Google
          Calendar integration. Mostly, I completed a project for my first
          client: myself!
