      <p class="col-8">
        Artifact is a personal podcast startup. Say you want to commemorate your
        sister's college graduation with a story detailing some of her best
        friends' favorite moments with her. Artifact is a hands-off
        personal-podcast making service that brings that story to fruition. They
        schedule the interviews, do the editing, and deliver the podcast in
        personalized website format.
      </p>
      <p class="col-8">
        For a school assignment, my group chose to make Artifact's website,
        which is where users place their orders. We focused on three things in
        particular: the order form, the order backend, and the product itself.

          </li>
          <li>
            Artifact makes personal gift, and so Artifact’s logo should be very
            minimal on the product page. Think of this as Digital Packaging.
            Think of the how product delivery should play out.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is no need for the profile page to track Artifact received,
            that should be the responsibility of the receiver. Instead, only
            support gift management.
          </li>
          <li>
            On “Your Orders”, the distinction between finished and unfinished
            Artifacts should be clearer.
